ðŸ“‚ **Repository Contents**

This portfolio repository is designed to showcase specific projects and learning milestones. Here's a breakdown of the key files directly related to my data science and machine learning journey:

* **`matplotlib.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook)**: This file represents an **interactive learning module focused on Matplotlib**, a powerful Python library for data visualization. It contains live code, explanatory text, and outputs, demonstrating fundamental plotting techniques. This notebook is a testament to my ability to explore and visualize data effectively, a crucial skill in AI and ML workflows.

* **`time.csv` (Dataset)**: This comma-separated values (CSV) file serves as a **sample dataset** for practical exercises in data loading, manipulation, and visualization using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. Specifically, it contains time data (in 12-hour and 24-hour formats) which I've used to practice creating different types of plots, such as the bar chart demonstrated earlier. Its inclusion highlights my hands-on experience with real-world data.

* **`README.md` (Project Overview)**: This very `README.md` file is essential for providing a **comprehensive overview of this portfolio repository**. It details the project's purpose, outlines the key features of the website, lists the technologies used, and provides clear setup and contact information. A wellðŸ“‚ **Repository Contents**
